# OptiNOC

**OptiNOC** is an open-source, intelligent network discovery and monitoring platform built with Django. Designed as a modern alternative to traditional tools like Auvik, OptiNOC provides comprehensive network visibility, asset fingerprinting, real-time monitoring, and logical topology mapping.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Network Discovery**  
  Uses SNMP, SSH, Telnet, CDP, LLDP, ARP/CAM tables, HTTP(S), and more to identify assets and map connections.

- **Asset Fingerprinting & Inventory**  
  Classifies devices with vendor, model, OS, interface data, and environmental metadata.

- **Logical Network Mapping**  
  Visualizes device relationships and topologies based on link-layer discovery and MAC/IP mapping.

- **Roadblock Identification**  
  Highlights missing credentials, incorrect SNMP community strings, blocked ports, and other issues that prevent full visibility.

- **Monitoring & Baselines**  
  Tracks device performance (CPU, memory, interface stats), uptime, and latency over time with graphs and alerting.

- **Tags, Alerts & Profiles**  
  Organize assets with tags and configure threshold-based alert profiles to fit your environment.

- **On-Premise & Secure**  
  Built for single-organization use with Django local auth and on-premise deployment. No cloud dependencies.
